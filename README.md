Create repository for portfolio
This is my second submission at my first front-end nanodegree project. This portfolio will be an ongoing work
and currently contains only placeholder images. As projects are finished and new technologies are learned,
I will be updating my portfolio to reflect my latest skills. At some point the portfolio will likely be scrapped
altogether following our lessons on knockout.js and built up from scratch.
